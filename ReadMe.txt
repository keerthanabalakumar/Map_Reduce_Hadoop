Mapclass class:
The Mapclass maps the key to the values. The key used here by me is the tablename ( R, S here). The rest of the attributes are considered values which are 
mapped with the key.

Reduceclass class:
This class iterates the values from the tablejoin column . It works on the values, creating the output rows and subsequently writing them to the output file.
